# Towards the Law Enforcement of Firearms

## Abstract 
The rate of violence in the world has increased tremendously in the last 15 years. Using and even carrying firearms in public places is not legal in most countries, but still Legal and illegal guns play a significant role in violence incidents across the globe on the streets. In the paper, we discuss a computer vision-based approach to detect the people carrying firearms in public places using the CCTV camera system. Our approach also classifies the potential threat that can be caused by firearms. Along with the paper, we also release the high- quality corpora of guns that can be used for various detection and classification tasks by the researcher community. Apart from usage in cities and towns, the army can employ these systems to keep a check on the cross-border connecting roads and high tension areas.
